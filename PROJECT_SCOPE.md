## Goal
Train an AI agent to play Tetris using board-state features, not pixels.

## Constraints
- Use an existing Python Tetris engine (python-tetris)
- No emulator-based environments
- No image-based learning
- Deterministic action space (macro placement actions)

## Phases
1. Imitation learning from a heuristic policy
2. Optional reinforcement learning fine-tuning

## Non-goals
- Writing a Tetris engine from scratch
- Training from raw screen captures
