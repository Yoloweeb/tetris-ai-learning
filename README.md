# Tetris AI Project

This project trains an AI agent to play Tetris using a compact board-state
representation (20x10 grid), not raw images.

Approach:
- Phase 1: Imitation learning from a heuristic Tetris AI
- Phase 2 (optional): Reinforcement learning fine-tuning

The project reuses structural ideas from a previous Pokémon AI project
(collector → dataset → model → play loop).
